#Encrypt and Decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
A Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It supports encryption, decryption, case sensitivity, and handles non-alphabetic characters. Ideal for learning cryptography basics and improving Python skills. User-friendly and perfect for beginners!
🚀 Features
Encryption: Converts plain text into cipher text using a user-defined shift value.
Decryption: Restores the original message by reversing the shift.
Case Sensitivity: Maintains uppercase and lowercase characters.
Non-Alphabet Support: Leaves symbols, numbers, and spaces unaltered.
User-Friendly: Command-line interface with clear prompts for input.

📋 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the input text by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. 
For example:
Encrypt: "HELLO" with a shift of 3 becomes "KHOOR".
Decrypt: "KHOOR" with the same shift returns "HELLO".
This program uses modular arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet and ensures all characters are processed correctly.
